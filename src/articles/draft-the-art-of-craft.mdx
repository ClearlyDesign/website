In a recent project Nekst Directory, we took an interesting and fresh approach to the project. Normally we'd kick things off with wireframes, some visual design then after approval to get client buy-in move over to coding it up. This was a "UX First MVP" and in the interest of moving fast, we jumped straight to code, creating from a central vision, building an in-depth PRD (Product Requirements Doc) which allowed us to explain our vision in detail, and get AI to poke holes in in, and help us refine the final PRD. Then moving to code was fast and the design took shape at the same time the product was being developed. At least 50-60% of dev time was spent on refining UX flows, and visual treatment, so getting it up and funtional is really quick, then it's the refinements and craft that really make it a Clearly Design - high standard - project. The beauty is, we could move so quick that within a week we could show tangible progress and still get stakeholder buy-in. Also if there were feedback, it's so quick to rework that you could iterate in code again, and no need to jump into Figma or static designs. In part this mostly worked because we had client trust and we've had previous projects with Nekst. If it was a brand new client, I think a moodboard to help set initial visual direction to get you on the same page could help crafting the initial idea.
