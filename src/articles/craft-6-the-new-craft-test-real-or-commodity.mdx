**There's a famous principle in design:** you're done not when there's nothing left to add, but when there's nothing left to take away.

It sounds elegant. In practice, it's *brutally hard.*

**Because adding is easy.** Anyone can layer on features, pile up options, accumulate capabilities. AI makes this faster than ever—generate screens, produce variations, ship more.

**Subtracting is hard.** It requires understanding why each element exists. What serves the user and what creates friction. What reinforces the brand and what dilutes it. What must stay and what needs to go.

**That understanding is craft.** And as commodity design floods the market, knowing how to spot craft becomes a critical skill for anyone building products.

## The flat white principle

**I love coffee.** Spent real money on a proper home setup because for me, there's a science to it.

Right beans. Right grind for the day's humidity. Exactly 18 grams, tamped with precisely the right force. Extracted at 7 bar over 25 seconds. Milk frothed to the perfect texture. Combined into a flat white.

Most people would enjoy that drink. Very few could tell you how it was made. Which steps mattered. What could be skipped.

**They just judge the result.** They love it or they don't.

**Products work the same way.** Users experience the outcome—does it solve their problem or create friction?—completely oblivious to the process that created it.

**This is why evaluating craft is hard.** The 90% that matters most is invisible. But if you know the questions to ask, you can see beneath the surface.

## Five questions that reveal craft

Whether you're evaluating a design partner, a new hire, or your own team's work, these questions separate craft from commodity:

### 1. "Walk me through why."

Pick any decision—a layout choice, a feature approach, a visual direction. Ask "why".

**Craft answers** connect decisions to user needs, business constraints, strategic positioning. There's a chain of reasoning. Each choice ladders up to something bigger.

**Commodity answers** are vague. "It looked good." "The AI generated this." "We liked this option." No connection to strategy or insight.

### 2. "What did you remove?"

Real design is subtractive. Features get killed. Flows get simplified. Options get consolidated.

**Craft** has a graveyard—ideas that were explored and deliberately rejected. Ask about what didn't make it and why.

**Commodity** adds without removing. If nothing was cut, nothing was truly designed.

### 3. "How does this connect to the rest?"

Pick an element. Ask how it relates to the broader product, the brand, the user journey.

**Craft** thinks in systems. Each piece reinforces others. There's coherence across touchpoints.

**Commodity** treats pieces in isolation. Elements were built separately, assembled without integration.

### 4. "What would happen if we changed X?"

Propose a modification. See if they can trace the implications.

**Craft** understands connections. Change this, and that breaks. Modify here, and it affects there. The team has a mental model of the whole.

**Commodity** can't answer confidently. They assembled outputs without understanding how pieces relate.

### 5. "Show me the process."

Ask to see the 90% below the iceberg. Discovery findings. Strategic decisions. Options explored. Iterations.

**Craft** has artifacts. Research summaries. Decision logs. Rejected directions with rationale.

**Commodity** has deliverables with no backstory. The process was prompting until something looked right.

Beyond questions, watch for these signals:

**No single-threaded strategy.** As you move through features, there's no clear logic. Each element makes sense alone; together, they don't add up. The product feels accumulated, not designed.

**Haphazard feature layering.** Capability piled on capability. More options, more complexity, more friction. No one made hard decisions about focus.

**Inconsistent patterns.** Similar actions work differently in different places. Visual language drifts across screens. You can feel the lack of underlying structure.

**Generic experience.** Remove the logo and it could be anyone's product. Design follows trends without interpretation. Nothing distinctive about the experience.

**Defensive responses.** When you ask why, the team gets uncomfortable or deflects. Craft welcomes scrutiny because there are real reasons behind decisions.

And here's what to look for on the positive side:

**Coherent backstory.** Every decision connects to something—user insight, business goal, strategic constraint. The team can explain the reasoning and it makes sense.

**Visible restraint.** The product does fewer things well rather than many things poorly. Someone made the hard calls about what to cut.

**Systems thinking.** Components relate to each other. Patterns are consistent. You can feel the underlying structure even before it's explained.

**Distinctive experience.** Cover the logo and you'd still know whose product this is. The design expresses something specific about the brand.

**Process artifacts.** There's evidence of thinking—research, explorations, rejected directions. The deliverable emerged from genuine process.

## Why this matters now

AI has made professional-looking design accessible to anyone. Commodity is easier to produce than ever before.

**This makes evaluation harder—and more important.**

Users will feel the difference between craft and commodity. They won't articulate it. They'll just love the product or abandon it. Like a perfect flat white, they know quality when they experience it.

Your job is to recognize craft before users render their verdict.

Ask the questions. Look for the signals. The 90% you can't see is what determines whether your product wins or becomes another forgettable entry in a crowded market.

**Craft is hard to produce. That's exactly why it's valuable.**

Learn to spot it.
