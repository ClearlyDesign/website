## OUTLINE - Designing Conversational AI

**Hook:**
- Chatbot market exceeding $1B by 2025
- 80% of businesses want chatbots by 2024
- But most conversational AI still feels robotic and frustrating

**Core Problem:**
- Teams focus on NLP technology, not conversation design
- Poor onboarding leaves users not knowing what to ask
- Generic responses break the illusion of intelligence

**Main Framework: The Conversation Design Stack**

### 1. Intent Architecture
- Map user goals to conversation flows
- Design for common paths and edge cases  
- Handle ambiguity and context switching
- **Example:** Customer support bots that understand complex, multi-part requests

### 2. Personality & Voice
- Consistent tone across all interactions
- Brand alignment in AI responses
- Contextual personality adjustments
- **Example:** Slack's friendly but professional AI assistant tone

### 3. Context Management
- Remember previous interactions
- Understand conversation history
- Handle interruptions and topic changes
- **Example:** ChatGPT maintaining context across long conversations

**Core Patterns:**

### The Guided Discovery
- Start with open-ended questions
- Progressively narrow based on responses
- Always offer escape hatches
- **Example:** "What kind of help do you need?" â†’ Specific options

### The Expert Interview
- AI asks clarifying questions like a consultant
- Builds understanding before providing solutions
- Shows reasoning and expertise
- **Example:** Legal or medical AI assistants gathering case details

### The Collaborative Partner
- AI and human work together on problems
- AI suggests, human decides
- Back-and-forth refinement process
- **Example:** Design AI helping iterate on creative work

**Key Design Elements:**

### Conversation Onboarding
- Show AI capabilities with examples
- Suggest good starting prompts
- Set expectations about limitations
- **Examples:** "Try asking me about..." suggestions

### Prompt Design Principles
- Clear, specific instructions work best
- Context-rich prompts get better responses
- Role-playing prompts for specific outputs
- **Template:** "Act as a [role] helping with [task]..."

### Error Recovery in Conversation
- "I didn't understand" isn't good enough
- Rephrase and try alternative approaches
- Offer human handoff gracefully
- **Example:** "Let me try understanding that differently..."

### Multimodal Conversations
- Text + images + voice working together
- Seamless switching between modalities
- Context preservation across modes
- **Example:** Describing an image then asking follow-up questions

**Advanced Patterns:**

### Dynamic Personality
- Adjust formality based on user preference
- Match energy levels and communication style
- Professional vs. casual modes
- **Example:** Code assistants being more technical with developers

### Memory and Personalization
- Remember user preferences and history
- Build on previous conversations
- Adapt to user communication patterns
- **Privacy balance:** What to remember vs. forget

### Multi-Turn Reasoning
- Break complex tasks into conversational steps
- Guide users through multi-step processes
- Maintain context across long interactions
- **Example:** Planning a trip through multiple conversation turns

**Voice-Specific Considerations:**
- Conversation markers and pacing
- Handling interruptions and speech errors
- Multimodal handoffs (voice to screen)
- Privacy and always-listening concerns

**Testing Conversational AI:**
- Red team testing with edge cases
- Testing across different user communication styles
- Conversation flow mapping and optimization
- A/B testing different personality approaches

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Generic, one-size-fits-all responses
- Breaking character or personality
- Poor context management
- No graceful failure modes
- Overstepping AI capabilities

**Questions for Product Teams:**
- What personality does your AI have?
- How do you onboard users to conversations?
- What happens when AI doesn't understand?
- How do you handle multi-turn conversations?
- What's your privacy strategy for conversation memory?
