## OUTLINE - Designing for AI Failures

**Hook:**
- Unlike traditional software, AI is probabilistic—failures are inevitable
- 23% of AI interactions result in unsatisfactory outputs
- How you handle failures determines user trust more than success rates

**Core Problem:**
- Most teams design for AI success, not failure
- Users expect perfect accuracy but AI delivers probabilistic results
- Poor error handling destroys trust faster than good features build it

**Main Framework: The AI Failure Spectrum**

### 1. Predictable Errors (System knows it's wrong)
- Low confidence scores
- Missing training data scenarios  
- Ambiguous user inputs
- **Design:** Show uncertainty, ask for clarification

### 2. Edge Case Failures (Unexpected scenarios)
- Novel use cases outside training data
- Complex multi-step reasoning breakdowns
- Context switching errors
- **Design:** Graceful degradation, human handoff

### 3. Silent Failures (System doesn't know it's wrong)
- Hallucinations and confident wrong answers
- Biased or inappropriate outputs
- Context misunderstanding
- **Design:** User feedback loops, verification systems

**Recovery Patterns:**

### The "Confidence Cascade"
- High confidence: Auto-proceed with user visibility
- Medium confidence: Show suggestion with explanation
- Low confidence: Ask for clarification or offer options
- **Example:** Voice assistants saying "I'm not sure, did you mean..."

### The "Graceful Degradation"
- AI fails → Simplified AI response
- Still fails → Basic rule-based response  
- Still fails → Human handoff
- **Example:** Chatbots escalating from AI to human support

### The "Learn-and-Recover"
- Acknowledge the error clearly
- Show what the AI learned from it
- Demonstrate improved behavior
- **Example:** "I made a mistake earlier. Here's what I learned..."

**UI Patterns for Failure States:**

### Error Communication
- Clear, non-technical error messages
- Specific guidance on next steps
- Visual hierarchy that doesn't blame the user
- **Example:** "I couldn't find that information. Try asking about..."

### Recovery Actions
- Easy retry mechanisms
- Alternative approaches suggested
- Human help readily available
- Feedback collection for improvement

### Learning Indicators
- Show AI is improving from errors
- Progress indicators for accuracy
- Version updates that address known issues

**Types of AI Errors:**
- Hallucinations (confident wrong answers)
- Misunderstanding context
- Bias in responses
- Technical failures
- Scope limitations

**Design Principles:**
- Fail fast and obviously (don't hide errors)
- Provide clear recovery paths
- Learn from every failure
- Maintain user agency
- Be honest about limitations

**Testing AI Failure States:**
- Red team testing for edge cases
- Bias testing across user groups
- Stress testing with unusual inputs
- Recovery path validation

**Questions for Product Teams:**
- How does your AI communicate uncertainty?
- What happens when AI is confidently wrong?
- Can users easily recover from AI mistakes?
- How do you learn from failures?
- What's your escalation strategy?
