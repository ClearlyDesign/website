faqs:
  - question: "How is this different from hiring a developer?"
    answer: "<strong>Speed and focus.</strong> We've built dozens of internal tools. We know the common patterns, the edge cases, and what actually works. A generalist developer will spend weeks figuring out what we already know. Design included. You're not just getting code. You're getting an interface your team will actually enjoy using. No developer UI that only makes sense to engineers. Complete handoff. We document everything and hand over clean, maintainable code. You're not dependent on us after launch."
  - question: "What if our needs change after you build it?"
    answer: "<strong>You own the code,</strong> so you can modify it anytime. Hire your own developer, use our monthly subscription for updates, or just leave it as-is. Many clients start with a fixed project, then use our monthly subscription for ongoing improvements. Totally flexible."
  - question: "Can you integrate with [specific tool]?"
    answer: "<strong>Probably yes.</strong> If it has an API or webhook support, we can connect to it. Common integrations: Airtable, Google Sheets, Shopify, Stripe, Slack, most CRMs, most project management tools. If it doesn't have an API, we can usually work around it with Zapier or Make as a bridge."
  - question: "Do you host it or do we?"
    answer: "<strong>Your choice.</strong> We can deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or your own hosting. Most clients use Vercel (free for most internal tools) or we can set up a simple DigitalOcean server. You own the hosting account either way. We're never a middleman."
  - question: "What if we need changes after launch?"
    answer: "First 30 days: Minor bug fixes and tweaks included. After that: You can handle changes yourself (you own the code), hire us on monthly subscription ($5-8K/month), or pay for project-based updates. Most clients don't need changes for 6-12 months. These tools are built to be stable."
  - question: "Is this actually cheaper than SaaS tools?"
    answer: "<strong>Run the math.</strong> If you're paying $2000/month across multiple tools for one workflow, a $15K custom tool pays for itself in 7-8 months. Every month after that is pure savings. Plus, you're not locked into price increases, seat limits, or feature changes you didn't ask for."

<h2 className="flex items-start gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container rose"><ExclamationTriangleIcon/></span></span> Here's what we're hearing from operations teams and agencies</h2>

**You're paying $50-200 per seat for tools that solve 20% of your workflow.** The other 80% still lives in spreadsheets, Slack threads, and manual processes. You've built workarounds on top of workarounds.

**Off-the-shelf tools force you to adapt your process to their limitations.** Your workflow is unique. Your clients have specific needs. But your tools were built for everyone, which means they're perfect for no one.

**You're juggling 5-8 different tools to accomplish one business process.** Airtable for tracking. Slack for notifications. Zapier to connect them. Google Sheets for reports. Each tool adds another $500-2000/month to your stack.

**Adding team members means exponential cost increases.** Your tools charge per seat. Hire three people and your monthly SaaS bill jumps $1500. Scale your agency and watch your margins shrink.

{/*
**Example:** A remote hiring agency was paying $180/month for an ATS, $300/month for scheduling tools, and $150/month for a candidate portal. Their recruiters still spent 4 hours per role manually screening applications because the tools didn't talk to each other.

We built them a custom candidate portal with integrated screening. Total cost: $14K. Payback period: 8 months. Screening time: down to 45 minutes per role.

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container emerald"><CheckBadgeIcon/></span></span> Here's how we solve it</h2>

We build custom internal tools as web applications. No app store. No per-seat pricing. Just software that fits your exact workflow and runs in any browser.

**This isn't enterprise software that takes 6 months and $200K.** We're talking focused tools that solve specific operational bottlenecks. Built in 3-4 weeks. Priced as one-time projects.

**Built for your workflow, not a generic solution.** We start by mapping your actual process. Where does work get stuck? What takes too long? What requires too many tools? Then we build exactly what eliminates those friction points.

**You own the code forever.** No subscription. No per-seat fees. No vendor lock-in. When the project is done, you own the entire codebase. Host it wherever you want. Modify it when your process changes.

**Integrates with tools you're already using.** We don't replace everything. We connect to Airtable, Google Sheets, your CRM, Slack, whatever you're already using. The custom tool becomes the hub that makes everything else work better.

**Pays for itself in saved SaaS costs.** Most projects cost $12-20K. If you're paying $2000/month across multiple tools for a workflow, that's a 6-10 month payback. After that, it's pure savings.

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container blue"><RocketLaunchIcon/></span></span> What's included</h2>

**Discovery & Planning:**
- Workflow mapping session (we document your current process)
- Tool audit (identify what you're paying for vs. actually using)
- Feature prioritization (what delivers the biggest time savings)
- Technical architecture planning

**Design & Development:**
- Custom application design (built for your team, not generic users)
- Full-stack web development (works on desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Integration with existing tools (APIs, webhooks, data sync)
- User roles and permissions if needed

**Testing & Handoff:**
- User acceptance testing with your team
- Bug fixes and refinements
- Documentation (how to use it, how to maintain it)
- Code repository handoff (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Discovery and design
- Weeks 2-3: Development and integration
- Week 4: Testing, refinements, and handoff

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container blue"><SwatchIcon/></span></span> How it works</h2>

**Step 1: Workflow Audit (Week 1)**
We spend 2-3 hours with your team understanding the current process. What tools are you using? Where do things break down? What takes the most time? We map the entire workflow and identify the highest-impact improvements.

**Step 2: Build the Tool (Weeks 2-3)**
We design and develop the custom application. You'll see progress updates throughout. We build in phases so you can provide feedback early rather than waiting until the end.

**Step 3: Test With Your Team (Week 4)**
Your team uses the tool in a staging environment. We fix bugs, adjust workflows, and refine the interface based on real usage. This isn't a demo. It's your actual team doing actual work.

**Step 4: Launch and Handoff (End of Week 4)**
We deploy to production, hand over the complete codebase, and document everything. You own it from day one. We can stick around for ongoing support if needed, but you're not locked into anything.

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container blue"><CurrencyDollarIcon/></span></span> Pricing</h2>

**$12,000 - $20,000** for most internal tools

What affects pricing:

**Lower end ($12-15K):**
- Single workflow (candidate screening, client onboarding, etc.)
- 2-3 integrations
- Basic user roles
- Standard web interface

**Higher end ($15-20K):**
- Multiple connected workflows
- Complex data processing or automation
- Advanced permissions and multi-tenant features
- Custom reporting and analytics

**Compare to ongoing costs:**

Typical SaaS stack for one workflow: $1500-3000/month
Custom tool: $12-20K one-time
Payback period: 6-12 months
Savings year 2+: $18-36K annually

**Monthly subscription alternative:**

Not ready to commit to a project? Our monthly design subscription includes development work. $5-8K/month, pause or cancel anytime. Good for ongoing iteration rather than fixed-scope builds.

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container yellow"><LightBulbIcon/></span></span> Questions for teams</h2>

Before scheduling a call, think through these questions. They'll help us determine if a custom tool is the right fit:

**Which tools are you paying for that you only use partially?** We're looking for cases where you need 3-4 features but pay for 20. Or where you're paying per seat but only use it occasionally.

**What manual processes eat up the most team time?** Data entry? Copying information between tools? Generating reports? These are perfect candidates for custom automation.

**Do you need this to integrate with existing systems?** Most custom tools work best when they connect to what you're already using. We can integrate with almost anything that has an API.

**Is this process stable or still changing rapidly?** Custom tools work best for processes that are mostly settled. If you're still experimenting with your workflow every month, you might not be ready yet.

**What's your budget and timeline?** Most projects are $12-20K and take 3-4 weeks. If you need something faster or have a smaller budget, let's talk about phasing the work.
