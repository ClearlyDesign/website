faqs:
  - question: "Do you integrate the designs into our codebase?"
    answer: "<strong>Not by default.</strong> We deliver design files (Figma), UX documentation, and optionally Tailwind CSS component code. Your team handles integration into your codebase. We can provide implementation support for an additional fee, but standard delivery is design handoff. This keeps costs down and lets your team maintain control."
  - question: "What exactly do we get at the end?"
    answer: "<strong>Complete design deliverables:</strong> Figma files with all screens and states, design system documentation (colors, typography, spacing), UX audit findings and recommendations, component specifications, and optionally HTML/Tailwind CSS component code. Everything your developers need to implement the designs."
  - question: "Can you build the components for us?"
    answer: "<strong>Yes, for an additional fee.</strong> Standard project is design delivery. If you want us to build production-ready Tailwind CSS components, that's available but adds cost and time. Most teams prefer to implement themselves since they know their codebase best."
  - question: "How is this different from an MVP Rebuild?"
    answer: "<strong>This is design work, not development.</strong> MVP Rebuild involves rearchitecting and rebuilding your product with code. Product Redesign is UX audit and UI design delivery. We're not touching your codebase unless you specifically add implementation services. If your tech stack needs rebuilding, that's MVP Rebuild territory."
  - question: "Do you only do visual design or UX improvements too?"
    answer: "<strong>Both, always.</strong> Visual design without UX improvements is just lipstick on a pig. We audit user flows, identify friction points, optimize navigation, and then design modern UI. You get UX strategy plus visual design, not just mockups."
  - question: "Will this disrupt our existing users?"
    answer: "<strong>That depends on implementation.</strong> We deliver designs and UX recommendations. How and when you roll them out is up to your team. We can advise on phased rollouts and testing strategies, but implementation timeline is your decision since your team handles the build."

<h2 className="flex items-start gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container rose"><ExclamationTriangleIcon/></span></span> Here's what we're hearing from revenue-stage companies</h2>

**Your product works, but it looks like it's from 2018.** You built fast. You found customers. But now when you demo to enterprise prospects, the dated interface makes you look less credible. Competitors with worse products look more professional because they invested in design.

**You built it yourself, and it shows.** Engineers built a product that works. But the UI feels clunky. Forms are confusing. Navigation doesn't make sense to new users. Your team knows how to use it, but onboarding new users takes forever because the UX is counterintuitive.

**Design debt has accumulated over years.** You've added features as you grew. Each new feature was designed in isolation. Now your product feels like five different products stitched together. Nothing is consistent. Users get confused moving between sections.

**Users complain about the experience but keep using it anyway.** They don't leave because your functionality is valuable. But NPS scores are lower than they should be. Support tickets about "how do I..." are constant. Users tolerate your product instead of loving it.

{/*
**Example:** A B2B analytics platform had 150 customers and $2M ARR. Their product worked well and delivered value. But their interface was built by engineers in 2019 and never updated.

Enterprise prospects in demos would say "this looks outdated" or "the UI feels clunky." Existing customers complained about confusing workflows. They were losing deals to prettier competitors with worse analytics.

They couldn't justify a full rebuild (too risky, too expensive). But they couldn't ignore the problem. Every sales call meant apologizing for the interface.

We redesigned their core product in 5 weeks. Same React codebase, same functionality. New visual design, streamlined workflows, modern interface patterns. Enterprise deals started closing. Customer satisfaction jumped 40%.

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container emerald"><CheckBadgeIcon/></span></span> Here's how we solve it</h2>

We audit your product's UX and redesign the UI. You get modern designs and UX strategy your team implements.

**This is design work, not development.** We deliver Figma files, design systems, UX recommendations, and optionally Tailwind CSS component code. Your team handles the implementation in your codebase. You maintain control, we provide the design expertise.

**Not just visual polish.** We audit user flows, identify friction points, and redesign the entire experience. It's UX strategy plus modern UI design. Better flows and better visuals.

### UX audit comes first

We analyze your product like real users would. We review analytics, watch session recordings, read support tickets, and identify where users struggle. The UX audit tells us what to fix before we design anything.

### Modern UI design system

We create a complete design system: colors, typography, spacing, components. Every screen designed in Figma with all states (loading, error, empty, success). Your developers get clear specs for implementation.

### Data-informed design decisions

Every design change is justified by user data or UX best practices. We're not redesigning for aesthetics. We're solving actual user problems identified in the audit. Design decisions are documented and explained.

### Optional: Tailwind CSS components

If you want implementation-ready code, we can deliver Tailwind CSS components. They're production-quality HTML/CSS, but your team still integrates them into your framework. This is optional and adds to project cost.

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container blue"><RocketLaunchIcon/></span></span> What's included</h2>

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container blue"><SwatchIcon/></span></span> How it works</h2>

**Step 1: UX Audit (Week 1)** — We use your product like a real user. We analyze analytics to see where people get stuck. We read support tickets to understand complaints. We interview your team and customers. We deliver a UX audit report with prioritized issues and recommendations.

**Step 2: Design System & UI Design (Weeks 2-4)** — We create the design system (colors, typography, components). We redesign key screens and workflows in Figma. You review designs, provide feedback, we iterate. Every design decision is explained and justified. You see the full vision before implementation starts.

**Step 3: Final Designs & Specifications (Weeks 4-5)** — We design remaining screens, all interaction states, and edge cases. We create developer handoff documentation with full specifications. If you purchased component code, we build Tailwind CSS components during this phase.

**Step 4: Handoff & Support (Week 6)** — We deliver all Figma files, documentation, and any code. We walk your team through the designs and answer questions. Your team implements in your codebase on your timeline. We're available for design questions during your implementation phase.

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container yellow"><LightBulbIcon/></span></span> Questions for product teams</h2>

Before we talk, think through these questions. They help us scope the redesign properly:

**Which parts of your product need the most improvement?** Core dashboard? Specific workflows? Everything? The more focused, the faster and cheaper. We can always phase additional areas later.

**Do you have user behavior data and analytics?** Session recordings, heatmaps, funnel data? This makes redesigns much more effective. We improve based on real usage, not assumptions.

**What do users complain about most?** Support tickets, feature requests, user interviews? These tell us where to focus. If users say "confusing navigation," we know that's priority one.

**What's your current tech stack?** React, Vue, Angular, something else? We work in your stack. If you're on something obscure, we need to know upfront.

**Do you have an existing design system?** Colors, fonts, component library? If yes, we extend it. If no, we create one. This affects timeline and cost.

**Can we do a gradual rollout?** Feature flags, beta testing, phased releases? This reduces risk. If not technically possible, we plan differently.
