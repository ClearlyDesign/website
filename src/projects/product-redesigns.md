faqs:
  - question: "How is this different from an MVP Rebuild?"
    answer: "<strong>Scope and risk.</strong> MVP Rebuild is for products that need new architecture, better tech stack, or can't scale. We're rebuilding the foundation. Product Redesigns keeps your existing foundation. We're improving what users see and interact with. Lower cost, lower risk, faster delivery. If your tech stack is good and your product scales fine, but it just looks/feels bad – this is the right project."
  - question: "Will this disrupt our existing users?"
    answer: "<strong>Minimal disruption.</strong> Functionality stays the same. Users might notice things look different, but they can still do everything they could before, just more easily. We can do gradual rollouts, A/B tests, or beta releases to minimize surprise. Most users react positively (\"finally!\" is common feedback)."
  - question: "Can you work with our existing engineering team?"
    answer: "<strong>Yes, that's the model.</strong> We don't work in isolation. We collaborate with your engineers. They review our code. They understand the changes because it's their codebase, just improved. Many teams have us work directly in their repo. Others prefer we provide components they integrate. Either works."
  - question: "What if users hate the new design?"
    answer: "<strong>Unlikely, but we plan for it.</strong> We test with real users before full launch. We can roll back easily because we're working in your existing codebase, not replacing it. We also document every change and why we made it. Design decisions are data-informed, not just aesthetic preferences."
  - question: "Do you only do visual design or UX improvements too?"
    answer: "<strong>Both, always.</strong> Visual design without UX improvements is just lipstick on a pig. UX improvements without visual design don't feel complete. We improve workflows, simplify navigation, fix confusion points, AND make it look modern. The goal is: easier to use and looks professional."
  - question: "What happens after the 4-6 weeks?"
    answer: "<strong>First 30 days:</strong> Minor adjustments and bug fixes included. After that: Three options: 1. Your team maintains it (we hand off everything cleanly) 2. Monthly subscription for ongoing improvements ($5-8K/month) 3. Future project-based redesigns when needed. Most products don't need major redesigns for 2-3 years after we're done."

<h2 className="flex items-start gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container rose"><ExclamationTriangleIcon/></span></span> Here's what we're hearing from revenue-stage companies</h2>

**Your product works, but it looks like it's from 2018.** You built fast. You found customers. But now when you demo to enterprise prospects, the dated interface makes you look less credible. Competitors with worse products look more professional because they invested in design.

**You built it yourself, and it shows.** Engineers built a product that works. But the UI feels clunky. Forms are confusing. Navigation doesn't make sense to new users. Your team knows how to use it, but onboarding new users takes forever because the UX is counterintuitive.

**Design debt has accumulated over years.** You've added features as you grew. Each new feature was designed in isolation. Now your product feels like five different products stitched together. Nothing is consistent. Users get confused moving between sections.

**Users complain about the experience but keep using it anyway.** They don't leave because your functionality is valuable. But NPS scores are lower than they should be. Support tickets about "how do I..." are constant. Users tolerate your product instead of loving it.

{/*
**Example:** A B2B analytics platform had 150 customers and $2M ARR. Their product worked well and delivered value. But their interface was built by engineers in 2019 and never updated.

Enterprise prospects in demos would say "this looks outdated" or "the UI feels clunky." Existing customers complained about confusing workflows. They were losing deals to prettier competitors with worse analytics.

They couldn't justify a full rebuild (too risky, too expensive). But they couldn't ignore the problem. Every sales call meant apologizing for the interface.

We redesigned their core product in 5 weeks. Same React codebase, same functionality. New visual design, streamlined workflows, modern interface patterns. Enterprise deals started closing. Customer satisfaction jumped 40%.

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container emerald"><CheckBadgeIcon/></span></span> Here's how we solve it</h2>

We redesign your product without rebuilding it. Same tech stack. Same functionality. Same database. Just better design and UX.

**This isn't a rebuild.** We work within your existing codebase. We're not changing architecture or rewriting features. We're improving how everything looks and feels. Lower risk, faster delivery, immediate improvement.

**Not just visual polish.** We improve workflows, simplify navigation, and fix UX issues. It's visual design plus user experience redesign. Your product becomes easier to use, not just prettier to look at.

### Work within your existing codebase

We don't start from scratch. We redesign components in your current tech stack (React, Vue, whatever you use). Your engineering team reviews our work. They're familiar with the code because it's theirs, just improved.

### Functionality stays exactly the same

Every feature works the same way for users. We're not removing things or changing behavior. We're making existing functionality look better and feel easier to use. No retraining required, just better experience.

### Data-informed improvements

We analyze your user behavior data, support tickets, and session recordings. We identify where users struggle. The redesign fixes actual pain points, not just aesthetic preferences. Every change is justified by user data.

### Phased rollout with minimal risk

We don't flip a switch and change everything overnight. We redesign in phases, test with real users, and deploy gradually. Your team can roll back anything that causes problems. Low risk, measurable improvement.

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container blue"><RocketLaunchIcon/></span></span> What's included</h2>

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container blue"><SwatchIcon/></span></span> How it works</h2>

**Step 1: Understand What's Broken (Week 1)** — We use your product like a real user. We analyze where people get stuck in your analytics. We read support tickets. We interview your team and customers. We identify the biggest UX problems and outdated design patterns. This becomes the priority list.

**Step 2: Design the Improvements (Weeks 1-2)** — We redesign key screens and workflows. You see mockups before we touch code. We present options and explain design decisions. Your team provides feedback. We iterate until you're confident in the direction.

**Step 3: Implement in Your Codebase (Weeks 3-5)** — We work directly in your repo (or provide clean component code). We redesign one section at a time. Your engineering team reviews pull requests. This isn't mysterious agency work. It's collaborative improvement of your existing code.

**Step 4: Test and Roll Out Gradually (Weeks 5-6)** — We test with real users before full launch. We can do beta releases, A/B tests, or gradual rollouts. If something doesn't work, we adjust. We monitor analytics to confirm improvements. Only when you're confident do we roll out to all users.

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container yellow"><LightBulbIcon/></span></span> Questions for product teams</h2>

Before we talk, think through these questions. They help us scope the redesign properly:

**Which parts of your product need the most improvement?** Core dashboard? Specific workflows? Everything? The more focused, the faster and cheaper. We can always phase additional areas later.

**Do you have user behavior data and analytics?** Session recordings, heatmaps, funnel data? This makes redesigns much more effective. We improve based on real usage, not assumptions.

**What do users complain about most?** Support tickets, feature requests, user interviews? These tell us where to focus. If users say "confusing navigation," we know that's priority one.

**What's your current tech stack?** React, Vue, Angular, something else? We work in your stack. If you're on something obscure, we need to know upfront.

**Do you have an existing design system?** Colors, fonts, component library? If yes, we extend it. If no, we create one. This affects timeline and cost.

**Can we do a gradual rollout?** Feature flags, beta testing, phased releases? This reduces risk. If not technically possible, we plan differently.
