faqs:
  - question: "Why 2 weeks instead of the typical 6-8?"
    answer: "We've built enough launch sites to have a repeatable process. No discovery sprawl, no endless revision rounds. Tight scope, clear deliverables, experienced team."
  - question: "What if we need changes after launch?"
    answer: "Included revisions cover feedback during the build. Post-launch we have maintenance packages or you can move to our subscription model for ongoing updates."
  - question: "Do you write the copy or do we need to provide it?"
    answer: "<strong>We can do either.</strong> If you have clear messaging, we'll design around your copy. If you need copywriting, that's an add-on (usually $2-3K depending on page count)."
  - question: "Framer or custom code? How do we decide?"
    answer: "<strong>Honest answer:</strong> If you're non-technical and don't plan to hire developers soon, Framer gives you the flexibility to make updates yourself. If you're engineering-led or planning to build an in-house team, custom Next.js means no platform fees and full control."
  - question: "What happens if we're not happy with the first design?"
    answer: "We include 2 revision rounds specifically for this. First round is usually about direction and tone. Second round is refinement. In 100+ projects, we've never had a founder walk away unhappy."
  - question: "Can you integrate with our existing tools (CRM, analytics, etc.)?"
    answer: "<strong>Basic integrations</strong> (Google Analytics, simple forms) are included. Complex integrations (Salesforce, custom APIs, etc.) may affect timeline and pricing, but we'll be upfront about that in the kickoff call."

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container rose"><ExclamationTriangleIcon/></span></span> Here's what we're hearing from founders</h2>

**"Agencies want 6-8 weeks and $25K, but we need to validate demand now."** You've built the product. Every day without a proper site is lost momentum.

**"We're technical enough to build the app, but frontend and conversion optimization isn't our strength."** You can ship features, but making landing pages that actually convert? That's a different skill set.

**"We tried DIY with WebFlow or Framer templates, but it looks generic and converts poorly."** Templates scream "startup on a budget." Visitors notice, and your conversion rate suffers.

**"We don't know if we should use WebFlow, Framer or build custom. Both feel risky."** Pick wrong and you'll either hit scaling limits fast or waste engineering time maintaining a marketing site.

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container emerald"><CheckBadgeIcon/></span></span> Here's how we solve it</h2>

We build conversion-focused launch sites in 2 weeks. Not just pretty pages, but sites designed to turn visitors into signups.

### The difference

**Stack decision based on your reality.** Non-technical founding team? Framer makes sense. Engineering-led and planning to hire devs? We'll build in Next.js so your team can own it. We make the call based on your technical capacity and growth plans, not our preferences.

**Conversion optimization built in.** We study your competitors, research your market, and structure pages to address objections and drive action. Every section has a job to do.

**Fast without cutting corners.** 2 weeks sounds aggressive, but we've done this enough times to know what works. Tight process, clear milestones, no scope creep.

**Easy handoff or ongoing partnership.** Launch and own it yourself, or keep us around for updates and optimization. Your choice.

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container blue"><RocketLaunchIcon/></span></span> What's included</h2>

**Full launch site package:**

- Competitor and market research (we analyze 5-8 competitors to understand what converts in your space)
- Conversion-optimized page structure (homepage, product, pricing, plus 2-3 supporting pages)
- Custom design system (colors, typography, components that match your brand)
- Responsive development (works perfectly on mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Basic AEO/SEO setup (meta tags, site structure, schema markup)
- Analytics integration (track what's working from day one)
- 2 rounds of revisions (we iterate based on your feedback)

**Timeline:** 2 weeks from kickoff to live site

**After delivery:** You own everything. Source files, design system, and full access to make changes yourself with your team, or we can help as you plan expanding the site in future.

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container blue"><SwatchIcon/></span></span> How it works</h2>

**Week 1: Research and Design**
- Day 1-2: Kickoff call, competitor research, content strategy
- Day 3-5: Design concepts, iterate on feedback
- Day 6-7: Final design approval, development kickoff

**Week 2: Build and Launch**
- Day 8-11: Development, responsive build, content integration
- Day 12-13: Your review, revisions, final tweaks
- Day 14: Launch, analytics setup, handoff documentation

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3" id="pricing"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container blue"><CurrencyDollarIcon/></span></span> Pricing</h2>

**$8,000 - $12,000** project-based

What affects pricing:
- Number of pages (5-page site vs 8-page site)
- Stack choice (Webflow vs custom Next.js)
- Integrations needed (CRM, analytics beyond Google Analytics, etc.)
- Content creation (if you need us to write copy, not just design around yours)

**Compared to our subscription:**
This is project-based with a defined scope and 2-week delivery. Our subscription ($5K/month) makes more sense if you need ongoing design work beyond the launch site, or if you're planning regular updates and A/B testing, etc. Most founders start with the launch project, then decide if subscription makes sense for growth phase or if there's product UX work we can help with as well.

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container yellow"><LightBulbIcon/></span></span> Questions for founders</h2>

Before we start, ask yourself:

**Do you have product-market fit or are you still validating?** If you're pre-validation, you might want something even leaner. If you've got traction, we'll build for scale.

**Will your team maintain the site or do you need ongoing support?** This determines whether Webflow or custom code makes more sense.

**What's your timeline to start taking signups?** If you need live in under 2 weeks, we can prioritize core pages and add supporting content later.

**Do you have brand assets (logo, colors) or are we starting from scratch?** We can work either way, but it affects timeline slightly.

**What's your competitor landscape like?** Crowded markets need stronger differentiation. Blue ocean products need more education.

**Do you have positioning and copy figured out?** We can work with what you have or help craft your positioning and final copy for the website.
