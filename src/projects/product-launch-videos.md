faqs:
  - question: "What style of animation do you use?"
    answer: "<strong>Modern 2D motion graphics.</strong> Clean, professional animation that fits SaaS brands. Not cartoony or overly playful. We match your brand style or create a visual direction that works for your product and audience. You see style frames before we animate anything."
  - question: "Do you write the script or do we provide it?"
    answer: "<strong>We write it.</strong> Script is included. We interview your team, understand your product, and write a script that explains it clearly. You review and approve before we design anything. If you already have a script, we can work from that too (may reduce cost slightly)."
  - question: "Can we use the video for multiple purposes?"
    answer: "<strong>Yes, you own it.</strong> Use it on your homepage, landing pages, ads, social media, sales decks, anywhere. We deliver the final video file in multiple formats. You can repurpose however you need. We can also deliver shorter cuts for social if you want (additional fee for extra editing)."
  - question: "What if we need revisions after delivery?"
    answer: "<strong>Minor tweaks included for 30 days.</strong> Text changes, small timing adjustments, color corrections. Major changes (re-recording voiceover, re-animating sections) are billed separately. Most clients don't need changes after final approval because we iterate heavily during production."
  - question: "How involved do we need to be during production?"
    answer: "<strong>Moderate involvement.</strong> Initial kickoff and product walkthrough (1-2 hours). Script review and feedback (async). Storyboard/design review (1 hour call). Animation draft review (async). Voiceover selection. Most clients spend 5-7 hours total across the 4-week project."
  - question: "Can you create videos in other languages?"
    answer: "<strong>Yes, with translated scripts.</strong> If you provide translated scripts, we can produce versions with native-speaking voiceover talent. Each additional language adds cost for voiceover recording. Animation stays the same, just swap audio tracks."
  - question: "What if our product changes after the video is done?"
    answer: "<strong>Updates available for a fee.</strong> We keep project files for 6 months. Small updates (UI changes, text edits) are typically $500-1,000. Larger changes (new features, restructured narrative) cost more. Many clients create new videos for major updates rather than retrofitting old ones."
  - question: "Do you do live-action videos or just animation?"
    answer: "<strong>Animation only for this service.</strong> Live-action requires different production capabilities (filming, locations, talent, etc.). We specialize in animated explainers because they're more cost-effective, easier to update, and better for explaining complex SaaS products."

<h2 className="flex items-start gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container rose"><ExclamationTriangleIcon/></span></span> Why SaaS companies need explainer videos</h2>

**Prospects don't understand what you do.** You're getting traffic to your site, but bounce rates are high. People read your hero copy and still don't get it. Complex products need more than text. They need visual storytelling that shows the value in 60-90 seconds.

**Features don't sell themselves.** You launch new features and adoption is slow. Existing customers don't notice. Prospects don't understand the value. A feature launch video explains what it does, why it matters, and how to use it. Drives adoption and makes launches feel like launches.

**Sales demos take too long to show value.** Your sales team spends the first 10 minutes of every demo explaining basics. Prospects zone out or drop off. An explainer video gets everyone on the same page before the sales call. Your team spends time on questions and objections, not product education.

**Paid ads don't convert because the concept is unclear.** You're driving traffic with ads, but conversion rates are terrible. People click but don't understand the product fast enough. Video ads with clear explanations convert better than static images with vague promises.

**Competitors with worse products are winning with better marketing.** They have slick videos on their homepage. You have walls of text. First impressions matter. Professional explainer videos signal credibility and make complex products feel accessible.

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container emerald"><CheckBadgeIcon/></span></span> How we create videos that convert</h2>

We produce animated explainer videos specifically for SaaS companies. Not generic motion graphics. Videos designed to clarify complex products and drive conversions.

**Problem-solution storytelling, not feature lists.** We don't make videos that list features. We tell stories: here's the problem, here's how your product solves it, here's what happens next. Narrative-driven videos that connect emotionally while explaining logically.

**Scripts written for your specific audience.** Technical founders selling to developers need different language than marketing teams selling to executives. We write scripts tailored to how your audience thinks and what they care about. Clear language, no jargon unless your audience speaks that jargon.

**Modern motion graphics, not cartoon characters.** Clean 2D animation that feels professional and on-brand. We match your brand colors and visual style. The animation serves the story—no unnecessary flourishes that distract from the message.

### Built for conversion, not just views

We optimize videos for homepage placement, landing pages, and sales funnels. The goal isn't to win awards. It's to explain your product clearly and move prospects toward a signup, demo, or purchase.

### Voiceover and sound that matches your brand

Professional voiceover talent (you choose from samples), custom background music, sound effects. Audio quality matters. Bad audio makes great visuals feel amateur. We deliver studio-quality sound.

### Fast turnaround without sacrificing quality

Most agencies quote 8-12 weeks for explainer videos. We deliver in 4 weeks. Tight process, clear milestones, no endless revision cycles. You get a high-quality video fast so you can launch or ship features without waiting.

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container blue"><SwatchIcon/></span></span> How it works</h2>

**Step 1: Understand Your Product (Week 1)** — We start with a deep-dive call. What does your product do? Who's it for? What's confusing prospects right now? What action do you want viewers to take after watching? We research your competitors' videos to see what's working in your space. Then we write a script that explains your product clearly in 60-90 seconds.

**Step 2: Design the Visual Story (Week 2)** — We create a storyboard showing each scene of the video. You see the flow before we animate anything. We design style frames that show the visual direction—colors, character style, UI mockups. We also record voiceover during this phase so timing is locked before animation starts.

**Step 3: Animate Everything (Week 3)** — We bring the storyboard to life. Scene by scene animation with smooth transitions. We share a draft for your feedback. You tell us what needs adjusting. We make revisions. The animation explains your product visually while the voiceover guides the narrative.

**Step 4: Finalize and Deliver (Week 4)** — We add background music, sound effects, and polish the audio mix. Final color grading and quality checks. We deliver the video in multiple formats (homepage embed, social media, ads). You get all files. Use it anywhere. We provide 30 days of support for minor tweaks after delivery.

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container yellow"><LightBulbIcon/></span></span> Questions to consider</h2>

Before we talk, think through these:

**What's the primary goal of the video?** Homepage explainer? Feature launch? Sales enablement? Paid ads? The goal shapes the script and call-to-action. Be specific about what action you want viewers to take.

**Who's the target audience?** Developers? Marketers? Operations teams? Executives? Enterprise buyers? The language, pacing, and technical depth changes based on who's watching.

**What's confusing about your product right now?** What do prospects not understand? What takes too long to explain? What questions come up repeatedly? The video should address these head-on.

**Do you have brand guidelines or visual preferences?** Colors, fonts, illustration styles? We can match existing brand materials or create a visual direction if you're early stage.

**Where will the video live?** Homepage hero? Product pages? Landing pages? Social media ads? Knowing placement helps us optimize aspect ratio, length, and pacing.

**What's your timeline?** Launching soon? Announcing at a conference? Need it for a funding pitch? We work backward from your deadline to ensure delivery on time.
