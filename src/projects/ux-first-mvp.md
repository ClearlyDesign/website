## Here's what we're hearing from founders trying to build their first version

**No-code tools are too limited for your concept.** Bubble and Airtable are great for simple CRUD apps. But your idea has complex workflows, specific user interactions, or features that no-code platforms just can't handle. You need real code, but hiring developers is $150K+/year.

**AI code generators ship fast but produce unusable products.** You tried v0, Loveable, and Bolt. They generate features quickly, but the UX is terrible. Forms don't guide users. Error states confuse people. Workflows that make sense to you are incomprehensible to actual users. You can't validate demand if users can't figure out how to use it.

**You're stuck between "too slow" and "too broken".** Custom agencies quote $50-100K and 3-6 months. AI generators ship in days but produce garbage UX. No-code works but limits your concept. You need something in between: fast enough to validate, good enough that people can actually use it.

**You know UX matters for validation but you're not a designer.** You're technical enough to understand architecture. Or business-minded enough to understand market fit. But you can't design interfaces that feel intuitive. Every founder says "just ship it" until they watch real users struggle with their MVP.

**Example:** A founder building a scheduling tool for distributed teams tried three approaches:

**Calendly-style no-code:** Couldn't handle the team coordination features his concept required.

**v0 generated version:** Shipped in 3 days. Looked fine. But users couldn't figure out how to create team schedules. Onboarding was confusing. Error messages were technical jargon. Got 50 signups, 2 active users.

**Custom agency quote:** $75K and 4 months. Too expensive and slow for validation.

We built a focused MVP in 5 weeks for $18K. Clear onboarding flow. Intuitive team scheduling. Proper error handling. Launched with 100 beta users, 60% became active. Found product-market fit in 8 weeks because users could actually use the product.

## Here's how we solve it

We build MVPs with one goal: help you validate demand as quickly as possible with UX good enough that users can actually test your concept.

**Not feature-complete products.** We're building just enough to test your core assumptions. The interface works well. The flows make sense. Users can complete tasks without confusion. That's the bar for validation.

**Not AI-generated chaos.** We design the user experience intentionally. Every workflow is thought through. Error states guide users. Onboarding teaches the product. This takes time, but it's the difference between validating and wasting months on a confusing product.

### UX-first approach to MVP development

Most developers build features and add UX later. We start with user flows and build features that fit them. The result: products users can figure out without documentation. That's critical for validation.

### Built for learning, not scaling

We're not building for 100K users. We're building for 50-500 early adopters who will tell you what's working. The architecture is good enough to prove demand, then you rebuild properly (or hire us for that too).

### Opinionated about what to include

You probably have 20 features in your head. We help you identify the 5-7 that actually test your core hypothesis. Fewer features, better UX, faster validation. More features come after you prove demand.

### Designed to evolve based on feedback

MVPs change. We build with that assumption. Clean code, clear structure, easy to modify. When users tell you what they actually need (vs. what you thought), pivoting is fast.

## What's included

**Discovery & Validation Planning:**
- Core hypothesis identification (what are we actually testing?)
- User flow mapping (how should people accomplish goals?)
- Feature prioritization (what's essential vs. nice-to-have)
- Competitive research (what UX patterns work in your space)
- Technical feasibility review

**UX Design & User Flows:**
- Wireframes for core flows (registration, main actions, key features)
- Interface design (intentional, not AI-generated randomness)
- Onboarding experience (users learn your product as they use it)
- Error states and edge cases (users know what went wrong and how to fix it)
- Mobile responsiveness (most early users will try on mobile)

**Development & Implementation:**
- Full-stack development (frontend + backend + database)
- Authentication and user management
- Core feature implementation (5-7 features max)
- Basic analytics integration (track what users actually do)
- Deployment and hosting setup

**Validation Support:**
- Beta testing strategy (how to recruit and structure feedback)
- Key metrics to track (what tells you if this is working)
- Iteration plan (how to evolve based on what you learn)
- Code handoff (clean, documented, ready to extend)

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Discovery and UX design
- Weeks 2-4: Core development
- Weeks 5-6: Testing, refinement, and launch

## How it works

**Step 1: Define What We're Testing (Week 1)** — We start with your hypothesis, not your feature list. What assumption needs to be true for this to work? Then we map the user journey that tests that assumption. This becomes the scope. Everything else is noise.

**Step 2: Design the Core Experience (Week 1-2)** — We design the critical flows first. Registration and onboarding (users' first impression). The main action (the value you're providing). The moment of delight (what makes this better than alternatives). Get these right, everything else follows.

**Step 3: Build the Essentials (Weeks 2-5)** — We build only what's needed to test your hypothesis. Clean architecture, intentional UX, proper error handling. You'll see progress weekly. We prioritize features that validate assumptions over features that "would be cool to have."

**Step 4: Launch and Learn (Week 6)** — We help you recruit beta users and structure feedback collection. You're not launching to the world. You're launching to 50-100 people who want to help shape the product. Their feedback tells you what to build next.

## Pricing

**$15,000 - $25,000** for most validation-stage MVPs

### What affects pricing

**Lower end ($15-18K):**
- Single-sided product (one user type)
- 5-7 core features
- Standard authentication
- No complex integrations
- Straightforward data model
- Example: SaaS tool, content platform, simple marketplace

**Mid-range ($18-22K):**
- Two-sided product (buyers and sellers, etc.)
- 7-10 core features
- Payment integration (Stripe)
- 1-2 third-party integrations
- More complex user permissions
- Example: Marketplace, booking platform, collaboration tool

**Higher end ($22-25K):**
- Multi-sided platform
- 10-12 core features
- Real-time functionality (chat, notifications)
- Complex workflow logic
- Multiple integrations
- Example: Team coordination tools, workflow automation, complex marketplaces

### Compare to other options

**No-code platforms:**
- Cost: $0-500/month
- Speed: 1-2 weeks
- Limitation: Can't handle complex concepts
- Best for: Simple CRUD validation

**AI code generators (v0, Loveable):**
- Cost: $20-100/month
- Speed: 1-3 days
- Limitation: Poor UX, inconsistent, hard to modify
- Best for: Quick prototypes, not real validation

**Custom development agency:**
- Cost: $50-100K
- Speed: 3-6 months
- Limitation: Too expensive and slow for validation
- Best for: Post-validation builds

**Our approach:**
- Cost: $15-25K
- Speed: 4-6 weeks
- Strength: Fast enough to validate, good enough UX to actually test
- Best for: Complex concepts that need proper UX

### Monthly subscription alternative

Rather build gradually while you're still refining the concept? Our monthly subscription ($5-8K/month) works for MVPs built over 2-3 months with ongoing iteration.

## Example projects

### Team Scheduling Platform

**Problem:** Founder needed scheduling tool for distributed teams. Calendly-style tools didn't handle team coordination. v0 generated version was too confusing for users to figure out.

**What we built:**
- Clear team creation and invitation flow
- Intuitive availability setting interface
- Smart conflict resolution when scheduling
- Slack integration for notifications
- Onboarding that taught the product

**Results:**
- Beta launch: 100 users invited, 60 became active
- Validation: Found PMF in 8 weeks with clear user feedback
- Traction: 15% converting to paid after trial
- Learning: Users wanted async scheduling most, not video calls
- Tech: Next.js + PostgreSQL + Slack API
- Timeline: 5-week build

**What happened next:** Raised pre-seed based on early traction, hired us for MVP rebuild phase.

### Freelancer Collaboration Tool

**Problem:** Designer building tool for freelancers to collaborate with clients. Tried building in Bubble, but real-time collaboration wasn't possible. Needed custom code but wasn't technical.

**What we built:**
- Client project dashboard
- File sharing with version control
- Commenting and feedback system
- Simple approval workflow
- Payment request features

**Results:**
- Beta: 40 freelancer + client pairs testing
- Validation: 70% said they'd pay, identified pricing willingness
- Learning: File versioning mattered more than real-time editing
- Pivot: Simplified based on what users actually used
- Tech: React + Supabase + Stripe
- Timeline: 6-week build including payment integration

**What happened next:** Founder joined accelerator, continued building with our monthly subscription.

### B2B Workflow Automation Tool

**Problem:** Technical founder trying to replace manual processes for operations teams. Concept too complex for no-code. Built prototype with AI tools but sales demos failed because UX was confusing.

**What we built:**
- Visual workflow builder (drag-and-drop)
- Template library for common workflows
- Integration with existing tools (Airtable, Slack)
- Clear error states and workflow testing
- Admin analytics dashboard

**Results:**
- Beta: 5 companies (15-30 people each) testing
- Validation: 4 of 5 wanted to become paying customers
- Pricing validation: Willing to pay $500-1500/month
- Learning: Templates mattered more than customization
- Tech: Next.js + PostgreSQL + integration APIs
- Timeline: 6-week build

**What happened next:** Secured first paying customers, raised seed round, hired full engineering team.

## Questions for founders

Think through these before we talk. They help us understand if you're ready to build and what to prioritize:

**Have you validated the problem exists?** We're building a solution. You should have evidence people have the problem. Talked to 20+ potential users? Seen them struggle with current options? If you're still testing problem fit, you might not be ready yet.

**Why can't no-code tools handle this?** Specifically, what limitations are you hitting? Complex workflows? Real-time features? Specific integrations? This helps us understand the technical requirements.

**What's the one thing users must be able to do?** Not three things. One. If users can do this one thing well, is that enough to validate demand? That becomes the MVP scope. Everything else is iteration.

**How will you recruit beta users?** Do you have an audience? A network in the space? A way to reach 50-100 early adopters? MVPs need users to test with. We can help with strategy, but you need some access to potential users.

**What's your timeline and budget?** Most MVPs are $15-25K and take 4-6 weeks. If that doesn't work, let's discuss phasing the work or adjusting scope. Better to build less well than more poorly.

## FAQ

### How is this different from the MVP Rebuild use case?

**Timing and risk.** MVP Rebuild is for founders who already validated demand in no-code tools. You've proven people want this. Now you need proper code.

This use case is earlier: You're still validating IF people want this. You need something good enough to test demand, but you're not proven yet.

Different stages, different approaches.

### Why not just use v0 or Loveable for initial validation?

**You can try.** Many founders do. Here's what we see:

AI generators are great for visual testing ("does this concept look interesting?"). But they're terrible for usage testing ("can people actually accomplish tasks?").

If your validation question is "will people sign up?" AI generators might work.

If your validation question is "will people use this regularly?" you need proper UX, which means intentional design.

### Can't I just hire a freelance developer cheaper?

**Maybe.** But here's the tradeoff:

A generalist developer will build what you ask for. We'll help you figure out what you should ask for. Most founders over-scope MVPs. We specialize in ruthless prioritization.

We also include UX design. Most developers don't. They'll build your feature list, but users won't know how to use it.

If you're confident in your scope and have design skills, a freelancer might work. Most founders aren't and don't.

### What if we need to pivot after launch?

**Expected and encouraged.** Every MVP changes based on user feedback.

We build with clean architecture and clear code specifically so pivoting is fast. Need to add a feature? Modify a flow? Change the user model? All doable without rebuilding.

Many clients stay on our monthly subscription ($5-8K/month) after MVP launch specifically for iteration support.

### Do you help with the business model and pricing?

**Strategy, yes. Execution, no.** We'll help you think through pricing validation (how to test willingness to pay). We can implement payment flows (Stripe integration).

But we're not business consultants. You need a hypothesis about monetization. We'll help you test it.

### What happens if we can't get traction?

**You'll learn why.** That's the point of MVPs.

Sometimes it's the concept (people don't want this). Sometimes it's positioning (wrong audience). Sometimes it's one missing feature.

Good MVPs tell you which. The UX is good enough that if people don't use it, you know it's not the interface. That's valuable learning, even if it's not the outcome you wanted.
