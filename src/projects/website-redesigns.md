faqs:
  - question: "How do you help us choose between Framer and Next.js?"
    answer: "<strong>We walk through your specific needs.</strong> We ask about your team structure, technical requirements, maintenance preferences, and future plans. Then we explain the tradeoffs honestly. We're not pushing you toward one or the other - we build in both regularly and care about the right fit."
  - question: "Can we switch platforms later if we choose wrong?"
    answer: "<strong>Yes, but it's work.</strong> If you start on Framer and later need Next.js (or vice versa), it's a migration project. Not impossible, but adds cost and time. That's why we spend time on platform selection upfront. Better to choose right the first time."
  - question: "Will rebuilding hurt our SEO?"
    answer: "<strong>No, if done correctly.</strong> We preserve URLs (or set up proper redirects), maintain meta tags, and keep site structure. Modern platforms (Framer and Next.js) are both great for SEO. We often improve SEO through better page speed and mobile optimization. We monitor rankings throughout and after launch."
  - question: "What if our current site is on WordPress or Webflow?"
    answer: "<strong>We rebuild on Framer or Next.js.</strong> We don't redesign in WordPress or Webflow. If your current site is on those platforms, we're migrating you to something better. That's the whole point - getting you onto a modern foundation."
  - question: "Do you write the copy or do we need to provide it?"
    answer: "<strong>We can help, but we're not copywriters.</strong> We provide messaging guidance, structure content, and write conversion-focused copy for CTAs and headlines. If you need extensive writing (full page copy, blog content), you'll either provide it or hire a copywriter. We can recommend people."
  - question: "How involved do we need to be during the project?"
    answer: "<strong>Moderate involvement.</strong> Initial kickoff (2-3 hours). Mid-point design review (1-2 hours). Pre-launch review (1 hour). Plus async feedback on designs. Most clients spend 8-10 hours total across the 3-6 week project."
  - question: "Can we update the site ourselves after launch?"
    answer: "<strong>Depends on platform choice.</strong> Framer sites: Yes, your marketing team can edit content, add pages, make updates (we provide training). Next.js sites: Requires developer for most changes (we provide documentation). This is one reason platform choice matters."
  - question: "What happens after the 30-day post-launch support?"
    answer: "<strong>Three options:</strong> 1) You maintain it yourself (we hand off everything cleanly) 2) Small retainer for occasional updates ($1-2K/month) 3) Ongoing subscription for continuous optimization ($5-8K/month). Most sites don't need much after a solid rebuild. Framer sites especially are self-sufficient."

<h2 className="flex items-start gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container rose"><ExclamationTriangleIcon/></span></span> Signs you need a full rebuild, not just a facelift</h2>

**Your site is held together with patches and workarounds.** Adding new pages is painful. Making updates takes longer than it should. Your CMS is clunky or your codebase is messy. You're avoiding changes because the site is fragile.

**The tech stack is outdated and limiting you.** Built on WordPress in 2018? Custom PHP stack your founder wrote? Old version of a framework you can't upgrade? The technology is actively holding you back from what you want to do.

**You're paying too much to host and maintain it.** Whether it's expensive WordPress hosting with plugins breaking constantly, or custom infrastructure that requires developer time every month. The operating costs don't match what modern platforms offer.

**Mobile experience is an afterthought.** Site wasn't built mobile-first. Responsive design is broken. Google is penalizing your search rankings. More than half your traffic is mobile but the experience is terrible.

**You want in-house editing but don't have it.** Every content change requires a developer. Marketing can't move fast. Landing pages take weeks to ship. You want your team to own updates without technical dependencies.

**The design looks dated and conversion is suffering.** First impressions matter. Your site signals "this company hasn't invested in themselves." Modern prospects expect modern design. You're losing credibility before anyone reads your copy.

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container emerald"><CheckBadgeIcon/></span></span> How we rebuild websites (the right way)</h2>

We rebuild marketing websites on modern platforms. Not bandaid fixes. Full rearchitecture from the ground up. First, we help you choose the right platform. Then we build it properly.

### We help you choose: No-code or custom stack

**Most companies guess at platform choice.** They pick based on what they know, not what's right for their needs. We walk you through the decision with real tradeoffs.

**Two paths we specialize in:**
1. **Framer** (No-code platform) - Visual builder, marketing team owns updates, fast to launch
2. **Next.js** (Custom stack) - Code-based, unlimited flexibility, scales with complex needs

We build in both. The choice depends on your team, budget, technical needs, and how you want to maintain the site long-term.

**Our recommendation process:**
- Understand your team structure (do you have developers on staff?)
- Review your technical requirements (complex integrations? Dynamic content?)
- Consider your maintenance preference (who will update the site?)
- Map future needs (what might you need in 12 months?)

Then we tell you honestly which platform makes sense. No steering you toward what's easier for us. We build in both regularly.

### Modern design and conversion focus

Regardless of platform, we design for conversion. Modern visual design, clear messaging, optimized user flows. Your site should look credible and drive action.

### Built from scratch, not templates

We don't use templates. Every site is designed specifically for your company, your audience, your goals. Custom design system, custom components, custom everything.

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container blue"><SwatchIcon/></span></span> How it works</h2>

**Step 1: Choose Your Platform (Week 1)** — We audit your current site, understand your team and technical needs, then walk you through the Framer vs Next.js decision. We explain tradeoffs honestly. No pushing you toward one or the other. The goal is the right platform for your specific situation, not what's easiest for us.

**Step 2: Design Everything from Scratch (Weeks 2-3)** — We design your new site with modern standards and conversion focus. Custom visual design, not templates. Information architecture that makes sense. Messaging that's clear. You review designs before we build anything. Feedback rounds until it's right.

**Step 3: Build on Your Chosen Platform (Weeks 3-5)** — We build in Framer or Next.js based on the platform decision. Clean code or clean Framer structure. Custom components. Proper SEO. Fast performance. Mobile-first responsive design. Integrations with your tools. Everything built properly from the start.

**Step 4: Launch and Hand Off (Week 6)** — We test everything thoroughly, optimize performance, set up hosting and domains, then launch. For Framer sites, we train your team to make updates. For Next.js sites, we provide documentation. You get 30 days of post-launch support for refinements and tweaks.

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3" id="pricing"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container blue"><CurrencyDollarIcon/></span></span> Pricing</h2>

**$8,000 - $12,000** for most marketing site rebuilds

### What affects pricing

**$8-9K (Framer, simpler sites):**
- 5-8 core pages
- Straightforward information architecture
- You provide copy, we structure it
- Standard integrations (forms, analytics, CRM)
- Minimal custom interactions

**$9-11K (Framer or Next.js, typical projects):**
- 8-12 core pages
- Custom design system from scratch
- Messaging and copywriting guidance
- CMS setup (Framer CMS or Next.js content layer)
- Custom animations and interactions
- Standard integrations

**$11-12K (Next.js, complex sites):**
- 12-15+ pages
- Complex information architecture
- Multiple user types or use cases to address
- Advanced integrations (custom APIs, complex CRM flows)
- Dynamic content or personalization
- Extensive conversion optimization

### Platform choice affects cost

**Framer builds:** Usually faster to build (visual interface), slightly lower cost. Best when marketing team wants editing control and technical needs are standard.

**Next.js builds:** Require more development time (code-based), slightly higher cost. Worth it when you need custom features, complex integrations, or plan to scale into product functionality later.

Both deliver modern, fast, professional results. Choice depends on your needs, not the budget.

### Compare to other options

**DIY with templates:**
- Cost: $500-2K + your time
- Time: 2-6 weeks (learning curve, trial and error)
- Result: Looks generic, limited customization
- Best for: Very early stage, no budget

**Freelance designer + developer:**
- Cost: $6-15K (separate designer and dev)
- Time: 6-12 weeks (coordination overhead)
- Risk: Design and dev handoff issues, misalignment
- Best for: If you already have relationships with both

**Traditional agency:**
- Cost: $25-60K
- Time: 8-16 weeks
- Overhead: Account managers, meetings, process bloat
- Best for: Enterprise budgets, committee decision-making

**Clearly Design:**
- Cost: $8-12K
- Time: 3-6 weeks
- Advantage: One team, design + dev + strategy, platform expertise
- Best for: Companies who need it done right, done fast

<h2 className="flex items-center gap-3"> <span className="flex items-center gap-3"><span className="icon-container yellow"><LightBulbIcon/></span></span> Questions to think through</h2>

Before we talk, consider these:

**Why rebuild now?** Is your current site technically broken? Costing you deals? Hard to maintain? Understanding the pain helps us prioritize what matters most in the rebuild.

**Who will maintain the site after launch?** Do you have developers on staff? Does marketing want to own updates? This heavily influences the Framer vs Next.js decision.

**What integrations do you need?** CRM, email marketing, analytics, payment processing? Some are standard, some require custom work. Better to map this upfront.

**Do you have brand assets?** Logo, colors, fonts, guidelines? If yes, we work within them. If no, we create a design system as part of the project.

**What's your content situation?** Is copy written and just needs design? Or do you need help with messaging and positioning? Scope changes based on this.

**How technical are your needs?** Simple marketing site? Or do you need custom features, user dashboards, dynamic content? Helps us recommend Framer vs Next.js honestly.
