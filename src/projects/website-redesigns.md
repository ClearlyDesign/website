## Here's what we're hearing from revenue-stage companies

**Your website looks like it's from 2019 and prospects notice.** You're getting traffic. You're getting demo requests. But you hear "your site looks dated" in sales calls. Competitors with worse products look more credible because they invested in design.

**You built fast to get to market, and it shows.** Launch was about speed, not polish. That made sense then. But now your site is costing you deals. Enterprise buyers expect professional design. Your DIY site signals "small company, might not be around."

**Your messaging has evolved but your site hasn't.** You've learned what resonates. You've refined your positioning. But your site still has the generic messaging from year one. New visitors don't understand what you do or why it matters.

**Conversion rates are lower than they should be.** You're driving traffic through content, ads, or referrals. But too many visitors bounce. Forms are confusing. Value propositions are buried. CTAs don't stand out. Small fixes could double your conversion rate.

**Example:** A B2B SaaS company with $3M ARR and 400 customers had a site built by their founding engineer in 2020. Functional, but dated. Generic hero sections. Unclear value prop. Mobile experience was broken.

Enterprise prospects would visit the site and then ask in sales calls "are you guys still in business?" Existing customers loved the product, but the site made them look unprofessional.

Full rebuild quotes were $40-60K and 3 months. Too expensive and risky for a site redesign. They couldn't justify it.

We redesigned their site in 3 weeks for $14K. Same Next.js stack, modern design, clearer messaging. Enterprise deal close rate went from 12% to 23%. Site visitors booking demos increased 40%.

## Here's how we solve it

We redesign marketing sites for revenue-stage companies. Modern design, conversion optimization, built in your existing stack. No migration, no downtime, no risk.

**Not a rebuild.** We work within your current framework (Next.js, WordPress, Webflow, whatever you have). Same hosting, same CMS, same deployment process. Just better design and better conversion.

**Not just visual polish.** We improve messaging, restructure information architecture, and optimize for conversion. It's design + UX + copywriting guidance. Your site becomes a revenue driver, not just a brochure.

### Work in your existing stack

We don't force you to migrate platforms. You're on WordPress? We redesign in WordPress. Next.js? We build there. Webflow? We work in Webflow. No platform risk, no URL migration nightmares.

### Conversion optimization, not just aesthetics

Pretty sites that don't convert are useless. We study your analytics, identify drop-off points, and redesign to remove friction. Better CTAs, clearer value props, streamlined navigation. Design decisions driven by conversion goals.

### Content and messaging guidance

Most sites fail because messaging is unclear, not because design is ugly. We help you clarify your positioning, restructure content, and write copy that resonates. (Or work with your existing content if it's already strong.)

### Fast delivery, minimal disruption

Most agencies quote 2-3 months for website redesigns. We deliver in 2-4 weeks. No endless revision cycles. No scope creep. Tight process, clear milestones, predictable delivery.

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Discovery, messaging, design direction
- Weeks 2-3: Design implementation and development
- Week 4: Testing, refinement, and launch

## How it works

**Step 1: Audit What's Not Working (Week 1)** — We analyze your site with fresh eyes. Where do visitors drop off? What messaging is unclear? What design patterns hurt credibility? We use your analytics, heatmaps, and session recordings. Then we map out exactly what needs to change and why.

**Step 2: Design Modern, Conversion-Focused Pages (Weeks 1-2)** — We redesign your core pages with two goals: look credible, convert better. Modern design patterns your audience expects. Clear value props that explain what you do. CTAs that stand out. Social proof that builds trust. You review mockups before we build anything.

**Step 3: Build in Your Existing Stack (Weeks 2-3)** — We implement the redesign in your current platform. No migration risk. Your URLs stay the same. Your SEO stays intact. Your team knows how to maintain it because it's the same stack, just better.

**Step 4: Test and Launch with Confidence (Week 4)** — We test on real devices, real browsers, real user scenarios. We can do staged rollouts (new traffic only, then all traffic) or flip the switch all at once. We monitor analytics post-launch and make adjustments. You get 30 days of refinement included.

## Questions for companies

Think through these before we talk:

**What specific problems is your current site causing?** Lost deals? Poor conversion? Confusing messaging? Be specific. This helps us prioritize what to fix first.

**Do you have analytics data?** Traffic sources, conversion rates, drop-off points? Data makes redesigns more effective. We optimize based on real user behavior, not guesses.

**What's your tech stack?** Next.js, WordPress, Webflow, something else? We work in your existing platform, but need to know what we're working with.

**Do you have brand guidelines?** Logo, colors, fonts? If yes, we extend them. If no, we create them as part of the redesign.

**What pages get the most traffic?** Homepage, product pages, pricing? We prioritize redesigning your highest-traffic pages for maximum impact.

**Do you need messaging help or is copy already strong?** We can help refine positioning and write copy, or work with what you have. Both work, just different scopes.

## FAQ

### Will this hurt our SEO?

**No, if done correctly.** We preserve URLs, maintain meta tags, keep your site structure. We actually often improve SEO through better page speed, clearer content hierarchy, and mobile optimization. We monitor rankings throughout and after launch.

### Can we do a gradual rollout instead of changing everything at once?

**Absolutely.** We can launch new design to new traffic only (via feature flag), do A/B tests, or roll out page by page. Whatever makes you comfortable. Most clients do homepage first, then other pages over 2-3 weeks.

### What if we want to change platforms during the redesign?

**Different project.** Platform migrations add risk, cost, and time. If you need to migrate (Webflow to Next.js, WordPress to Webflow, etc.), that's a separate conversation. We recommend redesigning first, then migrating later if needed.

### Do you help with copywriting?

**Yes, with guidance.** We're not full copywriters, but we help structure messaging, clarify value props, and write conversion-focused copy. If you need extensive writing (blog posts, long-form content), we partner with copywriters or you can hire separately.

### How involved do we need to be?

**Moderate involvement.** Initial kickoff (2-3 hours). Mid-point design review (1-2 hours). Pre-launch review (1 hour). Plus async feedback on designs. Most clients spend 8-10 hours total across the project.

### What happens after the 30-day post-launch period?

**Three options:**
1. You maintain it yourself (we hand off everything cleanly)
2. Retainer for small updates ($1-2K/month)
3. Monthly subscription for ongoing optimization ($5-8K/month)

Most sites don't need major work after a good redesign. Small tweaks here and there, maybe optimization based on data.

### Can you migrate our content from the old design?

**Included for structured content.** If your content is in a CMS or markdown files, migration is straightforward. If it's hardcoded across 50 HTML files, that's a different story (and adds time/cost).

### Do you provide training for our team?

**Yes, especially for CMS-based sites.** If you're on Webflow or WordPress, we show your team how to make updates, add pages, etc. For code-based sites (Next.js), we provide documentation. 1-hour training session included.
