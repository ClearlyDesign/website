            agreement by and between Clearly Digital, Inc (“Clearly Design”) and the
            client, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“Client”), with regard

            “Website”) and any other service, media form, channel, mobile website or
            mobile application related, linked or otherwise connected thereto. Failure to
            agree and adhere to all of the terms, conditions and obligations contained
            herein results in the express prohibition of the Client&#39;s use of the

            further force and effect between the parties, except that any obligation of
            Client to pay Clearly Design for services rendered shall remain and continue
            to be an ongoing obligation owed by Client to Clearly Design.

          <p>
            Clearly Design shall provide to Client design services as outlined in the
            service plan. The recurring fee is paid for access to such services, and
            submitting work requests are the sole responsibility of the client in order to
            utilize this service.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Obligations of Clearly Design</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Provide Client with a “design board” to submit new work requests as well as
              provide feedback on open work requests, which would form the centre of all
              communication around design requests;
            </li>
            <li>
              Once design requests are received, ensure timeous turnaround is adhered to
              in order to provide feedback and/or design options to Client for
              consideration;
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure we move swiftly from one design task to the next, once the initial
              task is approved and closed.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>4. Obligations of Client</h3>
          <ul>

              Client agrees to use the provided “design board” to submit new design
              requests;
            </li>
            <li>
              Client agrees to use the provided “design board” to review all design
              options in order to provide feedback for revision or close the task to move
              on to the next. Any delay in feedback would cause a delay in making changes
              or moving to the next task;
            </li>
            <li>
              Client agrees to pay all invoices on or before the Due Date specified on
              each invoice to avoid service disruption.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>5. Payment to Clearly Design</h3>
          <p>
            Clearly Design will invoice Client according to the renewal term. Invoices are
            paid in advance for the services during this period. Unless otherwise stated
            in the Statement of Work or Invoice, Client shall pay all invoices upon
            receipt. Unpaid invoices shall be considered in default after thirty (14) days
            of the due date shown on the invoice. Clearly Design reserves the right to
            charge Client an additional 5% penalty for all invoices that are in default.
            Clearly Design reserves the right to terminate this Agreement and cancel all
            services to Client for non-payment.
          </p>
          <h3>6. Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
          <p>
            Unless otherwise indicated, the Website is the property of Clearly Design and
            all source code, databases, functionality, software, website designs, audio,
            video, text, photographs and graphics of any nature and regardless of format
            (herein, collectively or individually, the “Content”) and the trademarks,
            service marks, and logos contained there (the “Marks”) are owned and
            controlled by Clearly Design and are protected by copyright and trademark laws
            and any other applicable intellectual property law or regulation of British
            Columbia, Canada, foreign jurisdictions and international conventions. The
            Content and Marks are provided “As-Is” for your information and personal use
            only. Except as expressly provided herein, no part of the Website and no
            Content may be copied, reproduced, aggregated, republished, uploaded, posted,
            displayed, encoded, translated, transmitted, distributed, sold, licensed, or
            otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose whatsoever, without Clearly

            rights in the Website, Content and Marks.
          </p>
          <h3>7. Ownership of Materials</h3>
          <p>
            Notwithstanding Clearly Design&#39;s ownership of Submissions, as described in
            Paragraph 10 (“Client Feedback”), all design and original source files created
            on Client&#39;s behalf (“Projects”) belong to Client, and Client shall be the
            sole owner of the copyright for all Projects. In the event that any operation
            of law would cause Clearly Design to become the owner of a Project, in whole
            or in part, rather than Client, Clearly Design irrevocably and perpetually
            assigns its entire interest in the Project to Client, without limitation.
            Client warrants that any and all materials provided to Clearly Design as
            examples or as material to be incorporated into a project during the design
            process are owned by Client and do not infringe on or misappropriate any third
            party&#39;s rights, including, but not limited to, all intellectual property
            rights and any right of publicity. Clearly Design always reserves the right to
            share the Client&#39;s design work publicly (social media, website, etc.)
            unless agreed upon as stated in section 24 (”Showcasing Design Work”) of this
            document.

            Website is hosted in the United States of America. Access of the Website from
            the EU, Asia or other region of the world may result in the applicability of
            laws, statutes or regulations differing from those of the United States which
            govern personal data collection, use or disclosure. Client&#39;s continued use
            of the Website and transfer of data to the United States constitutes express

            Clearly Design does not knowingly accept or solicit information from
            individuals under the age of 18. In accordance with the United States&#39;
            Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act, upon the receipt of actual
            knowledge that an individual under the age of 13 has provided personally
            identifiable information to Clearly Design without parental consent, Clearly
            Design shall delete that information as soon as reasonably practical.

            have no liability to Client for any loss or corruption of any such data and

          <h3>24. Showcasing Design Work</h3>
          <p>
            Clearly Design reserves the right to share design work on public digital
            channels including social media, and this website unless otherwise agreed
            upon. The Client reserves the right to issue an NDA between themselves and
            Clearly Design, which in turn would void the right of Clearly Design to share
            or discuss Client&#39;s work publicly.
          </p>
          <h3>25. Miscellaneous</h3>

            Website constitute the entire agreement and understanding between the Client
            and Clearly Design. Failure of Clearly Design to enforce any right or
            provision of these Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of such right or
            provision. If any provision or part of these Terms of Use is determined to be
            unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed from these
            Terms of Use but shall not otherwise affect the validity or unenforceability
            of the remaining provisions herein. Nothing in these Terms of Use, the Privacy
            Policy or on the Website shall be construed to constitute the forming of a
            joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship between Client
            and Clearly Design.
