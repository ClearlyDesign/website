    question: "How many designs could I get?",
    answer:
      "It all depends on how big your requests are and how many requests you have. We ask you to prioritize your requests to tell us what order to work in, and then start delivering designs one after the other. The faster the feedback and completion of the first task, the faster we can move to the next task, so it depends on you as well.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why wouldn&#39;t I just hire a full-time designer?",
    answer:
      "Well, if you really do the math, it would be a lot more expensive hiring someone with decades of experience. You&#39;ll exclusively work with senior-level designers which would easily cost you $120k+, require benefits, vacation days, etc. It adds up!",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a limit to how many requests I can have?",
    answer:
      "Nope. Once subscribed, you can add as many requests as you want to your &#39;backlog&#39;. We do all project management to ensure it flows as smoothly as possible. We&#39;ll keep working on all requests one at a time - or two on the integrator plan, based on the priority you set.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I&#39;m not happy with my designs?",
    answer:
      "Design is not a black and white process, we get that. We do our best to understand your desired outcome before we start to avoid having mismatched designs, and we totally expect some constructive feedback and revisions. Your approval - and happiness - is part of your design board and flow of each task.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I get hours, and do those hours &#39;roll-over&#39;?",
    answer:
      "Short answer is no. This is a subscription providing you with access to top-tier design talent. While you&#39;re subscribed, you have access to our team and we deliver on your design requests. In the same way that you have an employee for a certain number of hours per week, you can&#39;t increase their time next week if this week was a slow week.",
  },
  {
    question: "How fast will I receive my designs?",
    answer:
      "How long is a piece of string ;-) It depends on the complexity of the tasks, but we aim to deliver tasks or show progress within a couple of working days to contineously push it forward.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer refunds if I don&#39;t like the work?",
    answer:
      "To help set you at ease, we offer a 14-day money back guarantee that once you&#39;re subscribed and you receive your first design results, if you&#39;re not completely satisfied we would happily offer a full refund.",
  },
