## Problem Section

### Opening
Here's what we're seeing from AI-assisted dev teams:

### Pain Points

**Every feature looks designed by a different person (or AI).**
Your landing page uses one button style. Your dashboard uses another. The settings page looks like it came from a different product. You're moving fast with AI tools, but the inconsistency is starting to show.

**You're copy-pasting from v0, Cursor, and Copilot without a shared visual language.**
Each AI-generated component works fine individually. But together? Your product looks Frankenstein'd. Different spacing, different colors, different interaction patterns. Nothing feels intentional.

**Traditional design systems slow you down.**
You tried using a component library. Every time the AI generates code, it doesn't match your components. You spend hours retrofitting AI output to fit rigid components. The design system becomes friction, not help.

**You don't have a designer, but you need your product to look professional.**
Your team is engineers. You can ship features fast with AI assistance. But design consistency isn't something Cursor can figure out on its own. You need guidelines without becoming a design team.

### Real Scenario

**Example:** A 3-person team building a B2B SaaS tool was using v0 for UI generation and Cursor for implementation. They shipped 12 features in 8 weeks. But their product looked disjointed. Buttons were different sizes on different pages. Spacing was inconsistent. Forms didn't match tables.

When they demoed to potential customers, the feedback was consistent: "Feels early" and "Looks unpolished." Not because the features were bad. Because the visual inconsistency made it feel unfinished.

We built them a flexible design system with AI-friendly prompts. Same shipping velocity, but now every feature felt cohesive from day one.

## Solution Section

### Opening
Here's how we solve it:

### Approach Overview

We build design systems specifically for AI-assisted development. Not rigid component libraries that fight with AI-generated code. Instead: principles, patterns, and prompts that guide AI tools to generate consistent interfaces.

**This isn't a traditional design system.** Those assume you're hand-coding every component or using a specific framework. But you're using AI to generate code. That requires a different approach.

**We give you the vocabulary and constraints that make AI output consistent.** Clear color systems. Spacing scales. Typography rules. Button patterns. And most importantly: prompts you can feed to Cursor, Copilot, and v0 that generate on-brand code.

### Key Differentiators

**Built for AI tools, not against them**
Traditional design systems assume manual implementation. Ours assumes you're prompting AI to generate code. We optimize for that workflow. Each guideline includes example prompts that work with Cursor, Copilot, and v0.

**Guidelines, not handcuffs**
You won't find a 50-component library that you must use. Instead: clear principles (spacing scale, color usage, typography hierarchy) that AI tools can interpret flexibly. Your features stay diverse while feeling cohesive.

**Prompt library included**
The real value: reusable prompts that generate on-brand UI. "Create a data table following our design system" produces consistent results. "Add a modal using our patterns" matches your existing modals. The AI handles implementation, the prompts handle consistency.

**Designed for lean teams who ship fast**
If you had 10 engineers, you'd build a complex component library. But you're 2-5 people moving quickly. You need consistency without overhead. Our systems are intentionally lightweight: just enough structure to stay cohesive, not so much that it slows you down.

## What's Included

### Foundation & Principles
- Color system (primary, secondary, semantic colors with usage rules)
- Typography scale (hierarchy for headings, body, UI elements)
- Spacing system (consistent padding and margins)
- Layout patterns (grids, containers, responsive breakpoints)
- Interaction states (hover, active, disabled, loading)

### Component Patterns
- Button variations and usage guidelines
- Form element patterns (inputs, selects, checkboxes)
- Card and container patterns
- Table and data display patterns
- Modal and overlay patterns
- Navigation patterns

### AI Prompt Library
- Pre-written prompts for common UI patterns
- Cursor-specific snippets for component generation
- v0 prompt templates that match your system
- Copilot context files for better suggestions
- Examples: "Generate table with our design system applied"

### Documentation & Figma Files
- Living style guide (web-based, easy to reference)
- Figma design file with all patterns documented
- Code examples for each pattern
- Integration guide for AI tools
- Maintenance instructions

### Timeline
- Week 1: Foundation (colors, typography, spacing)
- Week 2: Core patterns and components
- Week 3: Prompt library and documentation

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: Audit Your Product (Week 1)
We review your existing product, identify inconsistencies, and extract patterns you're already using (even if unintentionally). We don't start from scratch. We formalize what's working and fix what's broken.

### Step 2: Build the Foundation (Week 1-2)
We establish colors, typography, and spacing that match your brand direction. This becomes the vocabulary for everything else. We test these foundations with AI tools to ensure they're AI-friendly.

### Step 3: Create Patterns and Prompts (Week 2-3)
We document common UI patterns (buttons, forms, tables, etc.) and write corresponding AI prompts. Each pattern includes: visual example, code example, and prompt template for generating it with AI tools.

### Step 4: Handoff and Integration (Week 3)
We deliver Figma files, documentation site, and prompt library. We train your team on using the prompts with Cursor/Copilot/v0. You start generating consistent UI immediately.

## Example Projects

### Project 1: B2B SaaS Analytics Platform

**Problem:** 3-person team using v0 and Cursor to ship features quickly. Product had 15 different button styles, inconsistent spacing, and typography all over the place. Looked "unfinished" in user demos.

**What we built:**
- Foundation system (colors, typography, 8pt spacing grid)
- 18 documented component patterns
- 35 AI prompts for common UI elements
- Cursor snippet library for quick generation
- Figma reference file

**Results:**
- Consistency: New features match existing ones automatically
- Speed: Still shipping features in days, not weeks
- Feedback: "Looks polished" replaced "feels early" in demos
- Maintenance: Team maintains it themselves with no designer
- Tech: React + Tailwind design tokens
- Timeline: 2.5-week build

---

### Project 2: Developer Tool Startup

**Problem:** 2-person founding team (both engineers) building dev tools. Using Copilot heavily. Each new view felt disconnected. No time to learn design, needed system that worked with their coding workflow.

**What we built:**
- Minimal color system (dark mode focused)
- Typography and code display patterns
- Data table and CLI-style component guidelines
- Copilot context files for better suggestions
- Prompt templates for v0

**Results:**
- Adoption: Founders using AI prompts for every new feature
- Consistency: Product feels intentionally designed
- Speed: No slowdown, same rapid shipping pace
- Hiring: Design system helped recruit first designer later
- Tech: Next.js + Tailwind CSS
- Timeline: 2-week build

---

### Project 3: Indie Hacker SaaS Suite

**Problem:** Solo founder building multiple micro-SaaS products. Each product looked different despite being under same brand. Wanted family resemblance without cookie-cutter sameness.

**What we built:**
- Flexible brand system (shared foundation, variable accents)
- 12 core patterns that adapt per product
- v0 prompt templates with product-specific variables
- Documentation on when to stay consistent vs. vary
- Notion-based style guide (founder's preference)

**Results:**
- Recognition: Users recognized products as related
- Flexibility: Each product had distinct personality within system
- Efficiency: Launching new products 40% faster
- Independence: Founder maintains system solo
- Tech: Mix of Next.js and React
- Timeline: 3-week build including brand work

## Questions for AI-Assisted Teams

Before scheduling a call, consider these questions. They help us scope the right system for your workflow:

**Which AI coding tools is your team using?**
Cursor? GitHub Copilot? v0? All of them? This affects which prompts and integration patterns we prioritize. Each tool has slightly different syntax and capabilities.

**Do you have an existing brand or are we creating one?**
If you have brand colors and fonts, we'll build the system around them. If not, we'll establish a minimal brand foundation that feels professional without extensive brand work.

**How technical is your team with design implementation?**
All engineers? One person with design eye? This determines how detailed the documentation needs to be and how much we explain design decisions vs. just providing patterns.

**Are you building one product or multiple?**
A single SaaS app needs a different system than a founder building multiple products. Multi-product systems need more flexibility built in.

**What's your biggest consistency problem right now?**
Buttons? Spacing? Forms? Data tables? Knowing where inconsistency is worst helps us prioritize which patterns to document first.

## FAQ

### Why can't we just use Shadcn or another component library?

**You can, and should if it fits.** But here's what we see: Teams use Shadcn, then ask v0 to generate features. v0 generates code that doesn't match Shadcn patterns. Now you're retrofitting AI output to fit Shadcn.

Our approach works differently. We create guidelines and prompts that generate code matching your needs. The AI becomes the implementation layer, not something you're fighting against.

If Shadcn works for you, great. We often build systems that complement Shadcn rather than replace it.

### Isn't AI going to make design systems obsolete?

**The opposite.** AI makes design systems more important, not less. AI can generate any design you describe. That's the problem. Without constraints, every generation is different.

Design systems are the constraints that make AI output consistent. They're the vocabulary AI uses to understand what "on-brand" means for your product.

Teams without design systems produce inconsistent products faster. Teams with AI-friendly design systems produce consistent products faster. Speed and consistency together.

### What if we hire a designer later?

**The system helps you hire better.** You're not asking designers to fix a mess. You're asking them to evolve an existing system. That's more attractive to senior designers.

The system we build is designed to be extended, not replaced. When you hire a designer, they'll have a foundation to build on rather than starting from scratch.

### Do you maintain the system as our product evolves?

**First 30 days:** Minor adjustments included (tweaking colors, refining patterns).

**After that:** Three options:
1. Maintain it yourself (it's built to be maintainable by engineers)
2. Monthly subscription for ongoing updates ($5-8K/month)
3. Project-based updates when you need major additions

Most teams maintain simple patterns themselves and hire us for major expansions (adding mobile guidelines, new product surfaces, etc.).

### What if AI tools change their APIs or capabilities?

**We document principles, not tool-specific tricks.** The core of the system (colors, spacing, patterns) doesn't change when Cursor updates. The prompts might need tweaking, but the foundation stays stable.

We also version the prompt library. When tools evolve, we can update prompts without rebuilding the entire system.

### Can this work with our existing tech stack?

**Yes.** We're framework-agnostic. React, Vue, Next.js, Svelte – doesn't matter. The principles work across all of them.

We typically deliver systems as Tailwind design tokens (most flexible) but can adapt to CSS variables, styled-components, or whatever your stack uses.
